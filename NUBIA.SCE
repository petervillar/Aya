It is a terracotta statuette in the shape of a crocodile.
/2
The gown is white and fairly plain.
/3
Sobek is pleased with your devotion and grants you his blessing. 
/4
Congratulations, you have become a priestess of the cult!
/5
The jar is already full.
/6
Carefully you fill the jar with water.
/7
You are not close to any source of water right now.
/8
A menacing crocodile lies silently in wait, only its eyes above the water.
/9
This is a relative calm area on this side of the oasis.
;Far away you can see some big palms in the middle of the otherwise desolate desert.
/10
A crocodile aggresively jumps, snaps at you, and begins pulling you into the water..
/11
*** You are dead ***
/12
A pair of rawhide sandals, which have seen prolonged wear.
/13
The lake provides fresh water supply to the area. 
/14
The acolyte does not seem to understand you.
/15
Who are you talking to?
/16
The acolyte bows and replies, "looking to become one of us?" 
/17
An acolyte of Sobek is here.
/18
Here you are, in Shedet, the last part of your journey...
/19
The acolyte says 
/20
"take this, enter the temple and find for yourself how..."
/21
"you appear not to be up to the task of becoming an apprentice priestes..."
/22
"I'm afraid your accent is too thick for me to understand."
/23
"hello" and smiles politely.
/24
The path is dusty and dry.
/25
"no one is permitted to enter the temple with their shoes on."
/26
As you step inside the temple dedicated to Sobek you feel the silence inside, your body relaxes and your mind refreshes with joy...
/27
On some engravings, Sobek appears next to other gods.
/28
You don't see anything remarkable about it.
/29
"everybody is required to observe strict standards of ritual purity in the sacred space."
/30
You remove your sandals, leaving your dusty feet exposed.
/31
Carefully you wash your feet.
/32
The acolyte looks tired and sweaty.
/33
You set yourself to sleep on the floor, and you fall asleep almost immediately...
/34
Shortly after you wake up, half remembering a particular intense and confusing dream about having God inside..
/35
You eat the little statuette, which somehow has turned edible.
/36
You would rather not eat that.
/37
A previously small, unseen room can be reached going east.
/38
It is made from one piece of stone, and is probably used for worshipping ceremonies.
/39
You consider taking a short nap, but maybe not right now.

        The Priestess of Sobek


You are Nubia the apprentice, ready to embark on the journey of becoming a priestess of the cult of Sobek.

/1
The entrance to the local temple of Sobek, features large stone pillars, which support a roof of huge stone slabs. A path to the east leads to to the riverside.
/2
This is an east-west path that wanders between the Fayoum oasis and the temple surroundings.
/3
The Oasis, where sand dunes suddenly turn into lush palm groves. A lake extends into the background, in the middle of the otherwise desolate desert. A dusty path leads to the west to a temple.
/4
The interior of the temple, decorated with stone engravings, is where sacred rituals are performed to honor the gods. 
/5
This is the hidden room, where the most precious and sacred artifacts of the cult are preserved. There is a stone altar in the middle of the room, dedicated to the god Sobek.
