- Nubia, young girl (forældreløs) lives small village, Nile's waters not growing so best solution is to try and pray to Sobek. Everbody in the village is worried, she talks to the village's headman and he mentions about travelling to Faiyum, join the cult of the crocodile and pray for the fertility of the land.

(Sobek was a god who brought fertility to the land, so why not. It is believed that Sobek created the nile from his sweat and he controls the waters and the fertility of the soil https://mythology.net/egyptian/egyptian-gods/sobek/)

- objects:
    * Sobek prayer bead bracelet (twelve beads, a reminder of the twelve parts of the Duat) -> hidden in the hidden room
    * pair of sandals, white gown -> worn
    * amulet (terracotta statuette in the shape of a crocodile) -> dørmand
    * jar -> floor
    * knife -> Nubia's hut
    * fresh reeds -> outside village
    
- So basically it goes like this:
  : Nubia asks headman, gets a written letter (papyrus) so she can join a caravan once she travels a bit down the river
  : she travels down the river (mends boat by cutting off the rotten parts and mending it with new reeds)
  : shows letter, gets to join the caravan
  : cutscene: she joins the caravans of camels trudging across ocher sand dunes etc..
